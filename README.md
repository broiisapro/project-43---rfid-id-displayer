# RFID Card Reader - Arduino

## Overview

This project enables your Arduino to read RFID card IDs using the MFRC522 RFID reader. When an RFID card is scanned, the unique ID of the card is output to the serial monitor. This setup is ideal for creating simple access control systems or for logging card scans.

## Features

- **Read RFID card IDs:** Outputs the unique ID of each RFID card scanned.
- **Easy setup:** Minimal wiring required with clear instructions.
- **Compatible with Arduino Uno:** The code and wiring guide are based on the Arduino Uno, but it can be easily adapted to other Arduino boards.

## Components Needed

- **Arduino Uno** (or other compatible Arduino boards)
- **MFRC522 RFID Module**
- **Jumper wires**

## Wiring Guide

The MFRC522 RFID reader communicates with the Arduino via the **SPI** protocol. Here's how to connect the RFID reader to the Arduino:

| **MFRC522 Pin** | **Arduino Pin** |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| **SDA (SS)**    | Pin 10          |
| **SCK**         | Pin 13          |
| **MOSI**        | Pin 11          |
| **MISO**        | Pin 12          |
| **IRQ**         | Not connected   |
| **GND**         | GND             |
| **RST**         | Pin 9           |
| **3.3V**        | 3.3V            |

## Installation

1. **Connect the components:**
   - Follow the wiring guide provided above to connect the MFRC522 module to the Arduino.

2. **Upload the Code:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE.
   - Copy the code above into a new Arduino sketch.
   - Select the correct board and port from the Tools menu.
   - Click on the "Upload" button.

3. **View the Output:**
   - Open the serial monitor from the Arduino IDE (make sure the baud rate is set to 9600).
   - Scan an RFID card in front of the reader. The card ID will be displayed in the serial monitor.

## Troubleshooting

- **No card detected:** Ensure the MFRC522 module is powered correctly (3.3V) and the wiring is set up as per the guide. Try using a different RFID card to see if the issue persists.
- **Communication errors:** Double-check your SPI wiring, especially the connections to the `SCK`, `MOSI`, `MISO`, `SS`, and `RST` pins.
- **Card ID not showing up correctly:** Ensure that the serial monitor's baud rate is set to 9600, and the code is properly uploaded to the Arduino.

## Future Enhancements

- **Access Control System:** Add functionality to compare the scanned card ID against a list of authorized cards, unlocking a door or triggering an event.
- **Logging System:** Store or log the RFID card scans to a file or database.
- **Integration with Web Services:** Connect the system to a web-based interface for remote monitoring and control.
